### Hi there, I'm Julia âœ¨

## Currently
- Building out my wishlist of ideas revolving around **reimagining existing systems** in travel, retail clothing, and sustainability
- Identifying use cases where technology can make a lasting impact on **underserved communities**
- Curating a **community of ambitious, creative individuals** to uplift one another

## Past
- Software Engineer @ Capital One (2021, 2022-2024)
- Software Engineer Intern @ JP Morgan Chase (2020)

## My Values
- Technology is one of the only industries where you can iterate quickly given the same time and energy in a day. So why not build? 
- Fulfilling work is one that encompasses hard problems, hard work, and great ambition.
- One of the most dangerous cycles to get stuck in is not questioning how you're spending on your time and what you're spending it on.
